# QuizGame-Assembly-Code
PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT A QUIZ GAME USING PIC16F877A Embedded project using assembly language .
designing a two-player quiz game using PIC 
microcontroller. Here the system will display all the messages on LCD to interact with the user. 
The player can select the question, options, start, and submit through the variable resistor (POT), 
switches, start button, and submit button respectively. For each player after displaying the question 
it will display the time limit on 7-segment display. Once the time is up or option submitted by the 
player it will go to the validation part and adds marks accordingly marks given. Here each player 
can select maximum of three questions. The bonus question is only two players can select reaming 
all only once. So total five questions are saved with their correct answers in the memory. Once the 
player completes all the questions the system will display the scores and depends on the score it 
will display the winner. 
The system is designed to control the quiz game using the PIC16F877A assembly language 
and the virtual circuit is designed and tested in proteus software version 8. For programing and
creation of the hex file is using MPLAB software.
